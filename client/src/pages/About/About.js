    <h2>About VG Nexus</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>Welcome to Video Game Nexus! This is a place for people to play, upload, share, and discuss javascript-based web games.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>You do not need an account to play games here, but if you choose to make an account, you can participate in our Forum and upload your own games. This website is a passion project for us; we are all about learning and helping each other become better at making websites and games, and we would like to extend an invitation to you to join us.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>While playing, you may chat with other users currently playing the same game. If you would like to upload a game, check out the Upload instructions--currently, Phaser is the javascript game framework we are most familiar with, so it is a good place for you to start. In theory, though, any javascript-based game that runs through an html canvas element should work. You may upvote games and comments you particularly like, and we are planning on implementing a more robust scoring system in the future. The forums are pretty standard, though there is currently no moderator support--that is planned for future development as well. Thus, the forums are currently an open sandbox. We are still keeping an eye on things, though, and we will take measures against malicious activity as we see fit.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>This started as a project for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp in October 2018, but we have many plans for additions to this site. We greatly appreciate your feedback, so if there is anything you would like to tell us, please let us know in the Technical Issues forum! We do not currently have a site email address, so the forum is the best place to reach us. So, with that said...</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>Happy gaming!</p>
    <br></br>
