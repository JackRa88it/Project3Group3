## VG Nexus

Video Game Nexus is a place for people to play, upload, share, and discuss javascript-based web games.


### Who can use this site?
You do not need an account to play games here, but if you choose to make an account, you can participate in our Forum and upload your own games. This website is a passion project for us; we are all about learning and helping each other become better at making websites and games, and we would like to extend an invitation to you to join us.


### What makes this site special?
While playing, you may chat with other users currently playing the same game. If you would like to upload a game, check out the Upload instructions--currently, Phaser is the javascript game framework we are most familiar with, so it is a good place for you to start. In theory, though, _**any javascript game**_ built to render through a `<canvas>` should work. Make sure that the canvas is rendered in your `index.html` file, which should be located at the top level of your project folder.

### Is this site fully functional?
You may upvote games and comments you particularly like, and we are planning on implementing a more robust scoring system in the future. The forums are pretty standard, though there is currently no moderator support--that is planned for future development as well. Thus, the forums are currently an open sandbox. We are still keeping an eye on things, though, and we will take measures against malicious activity as we see fit.


This started as a group project for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp in October 2018, but we are continuanlly adding more to the site as needed.
